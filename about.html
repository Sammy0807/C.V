                <p>As a web and cross platform mobile app developer, I constantly apply myself to stay abreast with modern web
                    development frameworks, the latest syntax and technology trends. Confident to take up any task and deliver
                    within projected time, my skills are applied from the development to deployment of an application, the
                    planning cycle, application scaling, best practices and cloud development-operations/architecture. I
                    bring focus and discipline in my projects, I show professionalism in design and execution to deliver
                    appropriately.

                <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
                <p>As a full stack web developer at Lodestar academy, i worked alone to develop the web application that service
                    all the online needs of the school. The portals' remote web server was designed with php laravel framework,
                    it uses MySQL database to store data, and bootstrap library for the front end styling.

                <p>Development Train is a non-profit organisation that caters to a host humanitarian volunteer programs. I designed
                    a landing page for the company, using HTML, CSS and Materialize. I used google fonts to give the user
                    a heuristic user experience.

                <h6>Mobile App Developer</h6>
                <p>The air quality mobile app was developed with react-native framework, and styled with googles material-ui
                    library. I did not need to design a server for this application, because all the data that serviced the
                    application was gotten from a remote API, which I got from the client.
